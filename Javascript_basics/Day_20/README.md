# Perfect Number

Today, I learnt about the concept of Perfect Number.

## Task
Calculate the sum of factorials of a number. If the sum is equal to the number itself then the number is perfect number.

## Example
If input is 496 then,<br>
Factors = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, and 248.<br>
Sum of factors = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 +248 = 496<br>
Hence, Perfect Number
  

## Input Format
  A single integer, num.

## Constraints
  * 0 < n < 10 <sup>3</sup>
  
### Test Cases
_ _ _ _

* **Case 1**

Input
```bash
  Enter the number: 496
```
Output
```bash
  the number is perfect.
```


* **Case 2**

_Input_
```zsh
  Enter the number: 15
```

_Output_

```bash
  15 is not a perfect number.
```
