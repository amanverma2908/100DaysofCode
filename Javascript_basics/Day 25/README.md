# Day 25
In Day 25 we learn about Testing Properties in JavaScript.

### Testing Properties
Is a way to testing whether properties are present or not

#### Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()
The ```hasOwnProperty()``` method returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property.

All descendents of Object inherit the ```hasOwnProperty``` method. This method can be used to determine whether an object has the specified property as a direct property of that object; unlike the in operator, this method does not check for a property in the object's prototype chain. If an Object is an Array, hasOwnProperty  method can check whether an index exists.

**Syntax**
```
obj.hasOwnProperty(property)
```

#### Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable()
The propertyIsEnumerable() method returns a Boolean indicating whether the specified property is enumerable.

Every object has a ```propertyIsEnumerable``` method. This method can determine whether the specified property in an object can be enumerated by a for...in loop, with the exception of properties inherited through the prototype chain. If the object does not have the specified property, this method returns false.

**Syntax**
```
obj.propertyIsEnumerable(property)
```
