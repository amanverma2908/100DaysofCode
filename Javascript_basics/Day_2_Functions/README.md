# JavaScript Functions

A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation, and produces output. Basically, a function is a set of statements that performs some tasks or does some computation and then return the result to the user.
### Syntax

```javascript
function functionName(Parameter1, Parameter2, ..)
{
  // Function body
}
```

## Program to take Input from user & check Palindrome.

  A palindrome is used to verify a sequence of numbers, strings, or letters that are read left to right and right to left to match the same characters or return the same sequence of characters. In simple terms, when the numbers, strings, or characters are reversed that return the same result as the original numbers or characters, it is called a Palindrome. For example, NITIN, 123454321, madam, etc

### Palindrome Algorithm
  Following are the steps to get the Palindrome in JavaScript, as follow:

  * Get the strings or numbers from the user.
  * Take a temporary variable that holds the numbers.
  * Reverse the given number.
  * Compare the original number with the reversed number
  * If the temporary and original number are same, it the number or string is a Palindrome.
  * Else the given string or number is not the Palindrome.


  
### Test Cases
_ _ _ _

* **Case 1**

Input
```bash
  Enter to check Palindrome: 12321
```
Output
```bash
    12321 is Palindrome.
```
* **Case 2**

_Input_
```zsh
  Enter to check Palindrome: 0
```

_Output_

```bash
    0 is Palindrome.
```

* **Case 3**

_Input_
```bash
  Enter to check Palindrome: madam
```
_Output_
```bash
    madam is Palindrome.
```
